# Overview

My Homelab utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps methodologies](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) to automate provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services. This documentation primarily serves as a reference for myself. Some of the content in this will be cross-posted from my [personal site](https://alexgardner.id.au/homelab).
